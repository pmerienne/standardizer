    Create a lean standard of work :
    - Provide concise and clear orientations to support someone who will produce something (a "piece").
    - Keep the standard easy to remember
    - Focus on the added value and user needs

    # About standard
    ## What's a standard
    A standard is a training material associated to the production of a piece. 
    It should give anyone the capacity to assess the quality of the piece they are producing.
    It should not be too specific, people need to apply this standard to their context

    A good standard captures :
    - **The intention**: why is it important? what do we want to achieve?
    - **The control points**: Key elements for identifying piece quality and why they are important
    - **The common mistakes** : Actions/gestures to avoid and with their consequences

    # Example of standard on (subject: cooking a apricot tart)
    ## ðŸŽ¯ Intention
    A great apricot tart is one of the best dessert in the world when the technique is mastered, but few people have this talent. 

    ## âœ… Control points
    - the apricots are melting and slightly caramelized
    - the crust is golden
    - the taste is between acid and sweet
    - every slice has a bit of side crust

    ## ðŸš¨ Common errors
    - cook with unripped abricots â†’ there won't be enough sugar in them to caramelize
    - make a square shape â†’  some people won't have any side crust or have too much of it
    - cook too hot â†’ the crust will appear faster but the abricots will burn
